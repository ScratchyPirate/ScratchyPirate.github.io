Software Engineer. Systems Engineer. Computer Mechanic. Game Designer.

The harder the challenge, the better opportunity to grow myself and contribute to the world. For that reason, I found 
a love for software engineering and project management. The ability to tangibly and incrementality add to the world is
fulfilling. I aim to do so as my most disciplined self.

Currently researching at WWU on Security in Federated Learning. Goal of my research is to survey existing inference 
attacks on Federated Learning systems, attacks on a system that can expose private data, and improve existing defense 
techniques against inference attacks. The overall goal is inform organizations of powerful and efficient inference 
attacks they should be mindful during risk management and which techniques and their improvements are the best fit for
internal their use.
