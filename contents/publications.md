Pravega C# to Rust Interop Library<br />
Developed a library for DELL by leading a team of undergraduate students using the Agile method over the course of a 
year that allows for data streaming in C# using DELL’s Pravega servers. This also involved researching and developing 
new methods of communicating between previously developed Pravega libraries in the Rust programming language and C#. 
Key architectures developed involve managing the communication of managed and unmanaged memory, asynchronous operations
across languages, and data transfer across languages.

I-5 Computers Job Ticket Software<br />
This Developed software for managing Job Tickets using industry design methods to 
plan and create. This gave I-5 Computers the ability to go paperless and keep track of Job Tickets on a local database.
Software is event-driven and is built upon Object-Oriented design principles using WinForms in C#. In addition, the 
company has adopted the software and is currently using it to record and manage customer jobs through the company’s 
local network. This software took 1.5 months to develop and was done using the Agile Project Management method. 
Project was documented during development and after completion to create a user manual.
This Later updates after deployment added a user database for people interacting 
with the system, salted and hashed passwords for users, encryption of critical user data, and file access permissions 
based on user.

Pokemon Adventure Quest<br />
Developed a table top role playing game based off of the popular media "Pokemon." Made for hobby and not for sale 
use.
Made in a similar way to how I would approach a software project, turning sections into modules and approached 
using the waterfall method. Currently being play tested and edited.
Beta released 5/28/24
